Completed: 

We have completed constructing a website that teaches 
people about the Chinese Zodiac. We have completed all the
required pages: homepage, 12 signs page, contact us page,
and a page for each of the individual animals. We used 
css for all styling on the website.  Every page of the 
website has been validated to strict XHTML1 standards.
Thee css page has also been validated.  We added a few
graphical elements to make the website visually more 
appealing.

Not completed:

The individual animal pages could have used more graphical
elements and text content.  

Major challenges:

It was difficult to style so many pages with a single css
document. Time management was difficult with so many other
obligations.
