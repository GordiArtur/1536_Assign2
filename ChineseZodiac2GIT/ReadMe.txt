Completed:

We have revamped our website to become mobile-friendly on any mobile device. The website size
is self adjustable based on the device resolution. Every page is mobile-friendly, including the home page
and contact us page. The mobile website did not lose any functionality over its desktop version.
The desktop version has not been changed visually.

Not completed:

Better website presentation on medium size devices such as tablets.

Major challenges:

Adjusting the entire website to become mobile-friendly, without visually changing the desktop version.
Also adjusting all the buttons and images to look presentable in any device resolution.
